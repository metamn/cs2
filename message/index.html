  <h2 id="ch1">1. design around the message</h2>

  <p>
    every website sells something. A book, a blog post, a subscription, a photo. Information.
  </p>
  <p>
    the first step is to identify <span>what the website sells,</span> the look and feel of the items, and how visitors will feel about them.
  </p>
  <p>
    in our case <a href="http://www.smuff.ro"  title="Smuff">Smuff</a> sells physical products represented by photos accompanied by both short and long descriptions and price. First and foremost we are in the business of selling photos.
  </p>
  <p>
    smuff products are high-tech, bleeding edge, unique, never seen before toys and useful gifts. Which make visitors <em>feel special,</em> lucky to have discovered them.
  </p>


  <p>
    guess what will the main design element be? Driving the entire site design? And what message will transmit?
  </p>

  </figure>
  
  
  <h3>the smuff product thumb</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>does it look interesting? Unique?</li>
    <li>does it make you happy?</li>
    <li>is it techy / geeky / cool?</li>
  </ol>

  <figure>
    <a href="http://www.smuff.ro" title="Smuff"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/smuff-product-thumbs-1.png" alt="Smuff product thumbs"></a>
  </figure>
  

  <p>
    the most important design elements of the page should engage the visitor to feel happy, cool, and powerful.
  </p>




  <h2 id="ch2">2. fit to screen</h2>
  <p>
    one major problem on desktop monitors is scrolling. More precisely sometimes you have to scroll to see the page as an ensemble.
  </p>
  <p>
    design should fit the screen. Long pages should be divided visually into smaller sections. On scrolling each new section should fit the screen.  
  </p>

      the second section.

  </figure>
  
  
  <p class="spacer"></p>
  
  <p>
    every section looks like a standalone page. Visitors can easily overview and understand the message. Then move to the next <em>slide</em>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    at Smuff we've done the same approach. Even the checkout page was fit into a single desktop window.

  <h2 id="ch3">3. focus points</h2>
  <p>
    jakob Nielsen, one of the most important usability experts narrows down perfectly: 
    
    <blockquote>
      "visitors can focus only on five things on a single page"
    </blockquote>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th colspan=2>focus point</th>
        <th>function</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>identity</td>
        <td>makes the visitor feeling safe, being in the right place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>offer</td>
        <td>what this page offers</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>values</td>
        <td>emphasize what your site does that's valuable from the user's point of view, as well as how you differ from key competitors.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>action</td>
        <td>emphasize the highest priority tasks so that users have a clear starting point for what to do next.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>entertainment</td>
        <td>if all above are not interesting for the user make it feel good by offering something fun which still connects / links back to your site.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  
  <p>
    implementing these usability rules is hard at first. You should compact visually all focus points. Many times their parts are scattered around the screen.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    at Smuff we've fully implemented these principles on the most important page&mdash;the product page&mdash;which takes around 70% of total traffic.

  <h2 id="ch4">4. reuse</h2>
  <p>
    what makes design strong and perfect is uniformity: a few design elements used and reused all over again. People can focus on five content blocks at once&mdash;this might be true also for design elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    good design stays out of the visitors' way. It is almost invisible&mdash;just assuring the perfect <em>flow</em> for a visitor to become customer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    it must seduce. Design should make an imprint in people's mind. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    at Smuff we've managed to make 44% of customers coming back. And we've got feedback about the perfect shopping experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    the one-click checkout page was unseen before. And the design is so simple people are focusing only on product images&mdash;which was the original goal.
  </p>
  
  
  
  
  <h2 id="ch5">5. summary</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>design follows the message.</li>
    <li>always fit content to the screen.</li>
    <li>drive your visitors attention.</li> 
    <li>keep your design lean by reusing elements.</li>
  </ol>
