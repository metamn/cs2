      <span>Despite</span> working with Smuff since 2006 the fully responsive version of their website come alive in 2013.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous version rolled out in 2010 was fully mobile compatible but not <em>responsive.</em> The look was similar but the content was less on mobiles than desktops.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since Smuff had no mobile app yet we've designed the website first for mobile then enhanced up to bigger displays.

      <span>To make</span> the website perfectly aligned we've employed content discipline.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Product thumbnails, title and short descriptions have exactly defined dimensions. This way the product grid looks uniform on all devices.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Better the content more awesome the design.

      We've realized early we are selling first of all images, <em>and</em>, according to Google Analytics product pages take 70% of all visits.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These findings combined together made to design a product page which displays the biggest product images possible and still leave a room for thumbnail navigation to present the product from different point of views.

      We knew Smuff products are techy / geeky / cool and make people feel happy. And let the design stand out of the way by elevating the product thumbnail as the most important design element. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The redesigned logo reflects the geekness of the site and that single orange color enhances the hapiness.

      We've put major focus on designing the checkout page.
      Studies show vistors drop shopping most likely at this last stage. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We've managed to create a single page checkout where returning users are <em>one click away from purchase</em>, and, new users have just a single additional step, the registration. Which is either a click on "Connect with Facebeook" or filling four fileds in a form. Without leaving the checkout screen.
