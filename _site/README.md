## Workflow

### 1. Content 
  
  **Customer:** Decisions & data hand over 
  
  **Contractor:** Consulting, backend development

  - This defines what design decisions to make before sketching
  - The backend must be 100% ready before doing any sketches
  - This will create a style guide for the backend: article archives, pages, single articles etc.
  
### 2. Sketches 

  **Customer:** Sketches
  
  **Contractor:** Finding technical solutions for challenging parts like maps, sliders etc

  - Based on rivers and islands from above the sketching can be done
  - This defines the number of pages and the complexity of pages
  - This defines project data: 
  
    - Number of pages
    - Price per page on average
    - Milestones and payments
    - Estimated project end and estimated budget
  
### 3. Style guide 

  **Contractor:** Build the atoms, molecules and organisms 
  
  **Customer:** Review, modify once, then accept

  - Do not start building pages and structures; everything will be complicated, many iterations will have to be done
  - Instead build from bottom up, prepare elements with responsive design, talk to customer, refine sketches, extend pages, and so on
  - This is a delivery like the final website; based on this Customer can extend easily the website later; or create graphic design based on it;
  - This is a milestone and must be billed accordingly
  - The style guide can be ready before all content is prepared 100% by Customer
  
### 4. Build

  - When everything is up build the pages and structures
  - Finalize the website in major browsers and devices

### 5. Test

  - Use Validators, Outliners, Lints
