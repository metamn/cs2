# Images (for desktop)

- use responsinator for mobile screenshots
- rotate monitor for tablet screenshots with responsinator
- for desktop create a 1440x846 screenshot and place into that PSD Macbook mockup
- save to PNG and resize to 1947x1152


# Images (for mobiles)

- a screenshot framed into a device mockup doesn't looks good on mobiles
- instead of a huge device mockup a simple, lightweight frame should be added
- this way the screenshot can be seen by visitors in almost full size

- the original desktop version screenshot is in landscape mode, for mobiles we need portrait mode
- the desktop version for mobiles must be re-shot, in a way, by a custom crop, which is more like portrait than landscape in its proportions.
- the browser's Awesome screenshot + crop tool can be used easily
