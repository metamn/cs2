Styleguide Driven Design

Using modern tools like SASS and Compass makes web design and front-end development real software development: guided by a process (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Lifecycle_Processes), structured by a paradigm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) create error-free and maintainable web products.

Unicorns have the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness; to render markup and style to code and make web products a joy to create, consume and commission.

Optimize for Happiness

The Ruby programming language was designed to increase programmer happiness. Writing Ruby code is supposed to be a pleasure. Happy people creating by pleasure injects infinite amount of goodwill into their work beaming up the final experience.

What is the ultimate goal of a project? Make both its consumers, owners and creators happy. In the web design and development world it seems some basic building blocks are missing. A tool which makes the creator happy and a tool which makes the owner happy.

Building perfect web systems is a hard problem. Even using more advanced, programming-like tools and frameworks like SASS  and Compass can make the final outcome visually scattered, inconsistent, distracting for the end user, hard to extend and build upon later for the project owner.

Is that possible to create a web product which delivers the message in the perfect way and ships developer independent source code?
