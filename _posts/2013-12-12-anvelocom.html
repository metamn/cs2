      anvelocom has hundreds of products related to each other. we've created a set of interconnected filters via a Wordpress plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
      the algorithm was a challenge due to the dynamic nature of the filters: editors can add/remove anytime a filter without additional programming needs.
