    <h3>mobile first design</h3>
    <p>
      having a strong mobile presence is essential for every e-commerce company. The best approach is to start with a responsive website then move up to a mobile app.

    <h3>clean and strong style</h3>
    
    <p>
      since anvelocom products look uniform we've choose a clean style to stay out of the visitor's way and let them focus on the product instead.

    <h3>complex filters</h3>
    <p>
      anvelocom has hundreds of products related to each other. we've created a set of interconnected filters via a Wordpress plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
      the algorithm was a challenge due to the dynamic nature of the filters: editors can add/remove anytime a filter without additional programming needs.

    <h3>focus on images</h3>
    <p>
      e-commerce websites are selling first of all images. following this principle the product page uses the largest image possible to help customers to decide.
