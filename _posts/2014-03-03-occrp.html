<article class="intro">
  <h1>OCCRP</h1>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://metamn.github.io/occrp" title="OCCRP">Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project</a> is an international media organization fighting against corruption.
  </p>
  <p>
    their old website needed to be completely redesigned and adapted to all devices.

  {% assign image_index = 2 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>responsiveness</h3>
    <p>
      we've employed the mobile-first responsive design paradigm and built everything from bottom up starting with the smallest screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      the final acceptance test was done on a huge projector; we've managed to scale even to the largest screen.
    </p>

  <h3>navigation</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 3 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>navigation</h3>
    <p>
      the biggest challenge was to create a navigation system accessible on all devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      on mobile we have a full screen navigation, on tablet we have the logo aligned left the menu to right, and on desktop screens we have the logo centered with menus around.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      this way on larger screens where there is room for playing the header is genuine magazine style.
    </p>

  <h3>adaptive content</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 5 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" small='true' %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>adaptive content</h3>
    <p>
      one of the requirements from OCCRP was to use as less white space as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      this lead to a design which uses different content for different devices. for example on a desktop screen we have a single Announcement where on tablet we have three of them filling the space down to Investigations.
    </p>

  <h3>content types and visual hierarchy</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 6 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" small='true' %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>content types and visual hierarchy</h3>
    <p>
      OCCRP has many types of articles: news, blog posts, investigations, projects, products in spotlight and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      an exciting exercise was to design each article type in such way to preserve it's common sense, and, to have the necessary visual weight established by it's level of importance.
    </p>

<article class="image tablet">
  <h3>classic grid layout</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 7 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" small='true' %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>classic grid layout</h3>
    <p>
      to make the site look busy we've used a classic grid instead of a modern grid where elements are positioned in asymmetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      the beauty of such a grid layout lies in the perfect order combined with the variety of the colors in article thumbnail images.
    </p>

<article class="image desktop">
  <h3>dark tone</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 8 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" small='true' %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>dark tone</h3>
    
    <p>
      OCCRP articles are about highly corrupt individuals, organizations and even murder.
      we've preserved this atmosphere by choosing dark colors and heavy decorative elements.
    </p>
  </aside>

<article class="image desktop">
  <h3>storytelling</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 9 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" small='true' %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>storytelling</h3>
    <p>
      interesting content is extensively linked to internal and external resources and contains many multimedia elements like video, slideshow, image gallery and more.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      with OCCRP we've designed these basic storytelling elements in such way to encourage navigation to other resources, and, in the same time to keep the story intact, presented as a standalone entity.
