<article class="intro">
  <h1>scatter</h1>
  
  <p>
    scatter is a local deals & advertising <mark>startup</mark> bringing offers near to you.
    my task was to create a series of landing pages which deliver the message.
  </p>
</article>

{% include services.html %}


<article class="image smartphone">
  <h3>responsive & full screen</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 2 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>responsive & full screen</h3>
    <p>
      the founders wanted a presentation-like solution: one message on a screen and sliding navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      making this requirement work on all devices was the technical challenge of this project.
    </p>
  </aside>

<article class="image smartphone">
  <h3>big typography</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 3 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>big typography</h3>
    <p>
      every major feature of Scatter was presented in a single sentence taking as much screen estate as possible to deliver the impact. 
    </p>
  </aside>
</article>


<article class="image tablet">
  <h3>lean design</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 4 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>lean design</h3>
    <p>
      through the design process we've used and reused a single design element, the rounded border, coming from the first letter of the Scatter logo.
    </p>
    <p>
      re-using components makes the design fit and the experience seamless.
    </p>
  </aside>

<article class="image desktop">
  <h3>big background images</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 5 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <h3>big background images</h3>
    <p>
      since Scatter has their web and mobile app ready we could create perfect background images featuring screenshots of their real product.
    </p>
    <p>
      big background images together with big typography are a very effective presentation tool.
    </p>

<article class="logo">
  <h3>the logo</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 1 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <p>
      simple and expressive, made only with HTML and CSS.
