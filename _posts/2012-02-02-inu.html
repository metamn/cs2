    <p>
      sometimes dark background gives better contrast to enjoy images on the web. we've added a persistent contrast switcher solution to let people have better experience.

  <h3>minimalism</h3>

  <p>
    we are presenting high quality photography with this portfolio. This made us to decide everything else will stay out of the viewers way.

  <h3>asymmetry</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 5 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <p>
      when browsing images / image thumbnails the classic, uniformly aligned grid is boring. with a little asymmetry we can drive viewers to see all thumbnails at once without getting tired by the uniformity.
