    <a href="http://reboot.org" title="Reboot">reboot</a> is an interesting startup designing and developing social contracts worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
    when redesigning their old website they've migrated also their Wordpress backend to support their rich content structures.

  <h3>content design</h3>

    <h3>content design</h3>
    <p>
      beside blog posts Reboot is dealing with complex case studies, team profile pages, work examples, multi-page mission statements &mdash; custom content Wordpress is not supporting by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      in the old website this metadata was stored into various, non-interconnected, individual plugins which made content administration a pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      as a first task the content structure was redesigned to be Wordpress native by eliminating all plugins.

    <h3>simple administration</h3>
    <p>
      we eliminated plugins by storing metadata in the default Wordpress database. this way anytime Wordpress is updated the data goes automatically with the update.  
    </p>
    <p>
      when metadata is integrated with Wordpress defaults the Dashboard is also cleaned up. Instead of having many extensions the new version had just one.

    <h3>plugin development</h3>
    <p>
      a single plugin was created to facilitate the input of metadata on all these screens where the default Wordpress functionality was not enough. 
    </p>
    <p>
      using native controls and integration into the original workflow Reboot editors could naturally add new content without extra visual and functional overhead.

    <h3>theme development</h3>
    <p>
      the next step was to create a Wordpress theme to retrieve metadata and integrate into the design.
    </p>
    <p>
      a semantic HTML5 template was created as a foundation for the upcoming front-end development phase.
