  <h3>ttf</h3>
  
  <p>
    Open Society Institution's Think Tank Fund was looking for a new agency for their future infographics, print and web projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    we've put together an expert team &mdash; <a href="http://isabelmeirelles.com/" title="Isabel Meirelles">Isabel Meirelles</a> on infographics, <a href="http://reszeghbotond.ro" title="Botond Reszegh">Botond Reszegh</a> on print &mdash; and come up with an unique, all in one solution: <mark>websites which print.</mark> even with rich content like infographics.

  <h3>rich interactions</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 3 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <p>
      by nature TTF projects are built on rich interactive components. we've did an extensive research, collected and tested all state-of-art open source libraries which are still responsive.

  <h3>focus on print</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 4 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <p>
      the main idea was to create the website in such way it can be printed anytime. we've carefully choose only those design elements which look the same on screen and paper.

  <h3>a website which prints</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 5 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}

    <p>
      it turned out making a website to print is ... nothing more than designing it for a new device, which is the <mark>paper</mark> in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      using responsive design techniques and choosing the right layout, colors, typographic and design elements any website can be printed.
