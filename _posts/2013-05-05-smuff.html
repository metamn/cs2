    <h3>smuff</h3>
    
    <p>
      smuff is a simple and elegant e-commerce website designed to convert visitors into customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      and yes we've managed to make <mark>44%</mark> of customers coming back.
    </p>

    <h3>responsive</h3>
    
    {% assign image_index = 2 %}
    {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
    
    <aside>
      <p>
        despite working with Smuff since 2006 the fully responsive version of their website come alive in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        the previous version rolled out in 2010 was fully mobile compatible but not <em>responsive.</em> The look was similar but the content was less on mobiles than desktops.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        since Smuff had no mobile app yet we've designed the website first for mobile then enhanced up to bigger displays.
      </p>

<article class="image smartphone right">
  <h3>content discipline</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 3 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <p>
      to make the website perfectly aligned we've employed content discipline.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      product thumbnails, title and short descriptions have exactly defined dimensions. This way the product grid looks uniform on all devices.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      better the content more awesome the design.
    </p>
  </aside>

<article class="image tablet left">
  <h3>selling images</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 4 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <p>
      we've realized early we are selling first of all images, <em>and</em>, according to Google Analytics product pages take 70% of all visits.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      these findings combined together made to design a product page which displays the biggest product images possible and still leave a room for thumbnail navigation to present the product from different point of views.
    </p>
  </aside>

<article class="image desktop">
  <h3>focus points</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 5 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <p>
      we knew Smuff products are techy / geeky / cool and make people feel happy. And let the design stand out of the way by elevating the product thumbnail as the most important design element. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      the redesigned logo reflects the geekness of the site and that single orange color enhances the hapiness.
    </p>
  </aside>

<article class="image desktop">
  <h3>single page, single click checkout</h3>
  
  {% assign image_index = 6 %}
  {% include responsive-images.html type='from post' link="" %}
  
  <aside>
    <p>
      we've put major focus on designing the checkout page.
      Studies show vistors drop shopping most likely at this last stage. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      we've managed to create a single page checkout where returning users are <em>one click away from purchase</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      new users have just a single additional step, the registration. Which is either a click on "Connect with Facebeook" or filling four fileds in a form. Without leaving the checkout screen.
