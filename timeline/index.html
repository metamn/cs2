  <h3>The Message</h3>
  <date>Mon, 10 March 2014</date>
  <div>
    <p>
      Csongor is one of the best <a href="http://uxdiogenes.com/blog/on-being-a-designer-and-a-developer-not-quite-unicorn-rare" title="Unicorn">unicorns (full stack designer and engineer)</a> available today.
    </p>
    <p>
      From consulting to deployment he knows best how to get the most out of your content / project goals and deliver your message across all devices and browsers.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Update</h4>
    <date>Wed, 07 May 2014</date>
    <p>
      He has also great product skills.
    </p>

  <h3>The Strategy</h3>
  <date>Mon, 10 March 2014</date>
  <div>
    <p>This site will be based mainly on images, screenshoots of websites Csongor created in the past.</p>
    <p>
      These portfolio images will have to deliver the message, before all. After seeing the portfolio visitors should have the feeling <em>this guy is ahead of it's time</em>, he is on the bleeding edge of web design and development.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then to tell visitors Csongor is more than a designer we should emphasize the development part of the portfolio. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We could show the technologies used to create each portfolio item (Wordpress, HTML5, SASS, Responsive design...) but that's already common to many other portfolio sites. In our case vistors should be elevated to a new level, to an edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of using technical buzzwords which will become obselete over time we can redefine <em>development</em> from the cutomer's point of view: a set of tools delivered and connected to, living together with the website which enable transparency and extendability, gives full control for the customer over the final deliverable and the process behind (design decisions).
    </p>
    
    <h4>Update</h4>
    <date>Wed, 07 May 2014</date>
    <p>
      Current portfolio items offer no extra deliverables. Exception is Smuff which is not just a simple website but a product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore extra deliverables must be put in posts and presented separately to visitors.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>


<section>
  <h3>Portfolio items</h3>
  <date>Fri, 21 March 2014</date>
  <div>
    <p>
      Creating (and finding for inspiration) a perfect web design & development portfolio is a hard problem. Why? Simple screenshoots of websites don't look good on small screens.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Every designer uses a trick to present portfolio items. Most of them are using a good looking image taken from the website to represent the website itself. Others are adding a gorgeous iMac or iPad frame to a poor website screenshoot. Even more long project descriptions are added to screenshoots to make the work look extensive.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here we will use the follwoing approach:
      <ul>
        <li>We will use whatever technique works to sell a portfolio item.</li>
        <li>Every portfolio item should sell itself regardless of it is just a simple logo or a complex website.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
</section>


<section>
  <h3>Articles</h3>
  <date>Wed, 07 May 2014</date>
  <div>
    <p>Once images are done the next content chunk are the articles. They are selling the benefits of the latest technologies and techniques we employ. They are also selling Csongor as a product guy / unicorn beside the designer & developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list of articles are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delivering the message</li>
      <li>Styleguide Driven Design and Development</li>
      <li>What is a web product?</li>
      <li>A short About page / bio to put everything in context</li>
      <li>What is an unicorn and why is the best for your project.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>


<section>
  <h3>Content and Structure Strategy</h3>
  <date>Wed, 07 May 2014</date>
  <div>
    <p>
      After the content (portfolio images + articles) is ready we have the big picture. Now we have to structure content in such way to fulfill our business goals, and, to comply with the latest web standards. 
    </p>
    <h4>Business Goals</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Contact Csongor for a project</li>
      <li>Recommend / Keep in touch with Csongor for possible future projects.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Industry Best Practices</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Each screen is a standalone entity with maximum five focus points and <a href="http://metamn.github.io/cs5/message" title="Delivering the message">delivers a message</a>. The message is based on UX research. </li>
      <li>The HTML5 structure is <a href="http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fits-csongor.com" title="HTML5 validator">valid</a> and <a href="http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http%3A%2F%2Fits-csongor.com%2F" title="HTML5 Outliner">semantically perfect</a>.</li>
    </ol>
</section>



<section>
  <h3>User Research / UX Design Part I.</h3>
  <date>Wed, 07 May 2014</date>
  <div>
    <p>
      Two types of visitors will come to this site: possible clients and peer web designers & developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clients will look for design, development skills and evidence of past successful projects. Their goal is to contact Csongor for a deal.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Peers will look for technical information. They will look for interesting articles and code to re-use in their projects. Their goal is to follow Csongor to learn more in the future.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Scenarios</h4>
    <p>
      Clients will look first to portfolio items. If they are pleased visually they will look for technologies matching their stack / requirements. If they are still curious they will look for other portfolio items until they want to contact Csongor.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Peers will primarily look for articles. Their exit point must be the "Follow Csongor on Twitter".
    </p>
    
    <p>The most important element of the content strategy is to make every standalone content entry (portfolio item, article) to sell itself. If not let visitors to find the next best item which sells itself.</p>
    
    <p>
      Summarizing, we need the following elements on every (portfolio item) page:
      <ol>
        <li>Stunning visual elements / screenshoots.</li>
        <li>A short story for every screenshot describing the advantages and the usefulness of the features presented.</li>
        <li>Technical terms to match the most poplular technology stacks.</li>
        <li>Call for action.</li>
        <li>Navigation to similar items.</li>
        <li>Navigation to all other items.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Design Principles</h3>
  <date>Wed, 09 May 2014</date>
  <div>
    <dl>
      <dt>Style / Message</dt>
      <dd>The final site must look techy & pro. It should transmit that Csongor is in the same way a tech guy like is a designer.</dd>
      
      <dt>Style / Elements</dt>
      <dd>Images worth more than any design element. They are the primary messengers of the site.</dd>
      <dd>Spaces will be separated by lines.</dd>
      <dd>Text will be decorated with colors.</dd>
      <dd>Use one separator and one color if possible.</dd>
      
      <dt>Approach</dt>
      <dd>Mobile Design First, then progressive enhancements for larger displays.</dd>
      <dd>Styleguide Driven Development & Design. Red-Green-Refactor.</dd>

  <h3>Prototyping</h3>
  <date>Wed, 09 May 2014</date>
  <div>
    <p>
      Based on the above Content and Structure strategy, User Research and Design Principles we can start sketching the design of the website.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Instead of wireframes (Photoshop, Skecth, etc ...) we use the browser as a design tool with real code behind. The advantages are multiple. Beside reducing the overall project time by half at least the native approach delivers immediate results on all devices.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Prototyping will reveal the look and feel of the final result. Tries to imagine the major design elements and most important pages. When done, at the next phase everything is polished to be perfect.
    </p>
    
    <p>The major pages /elements to be prototyped are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Csongor's introduction</li>
      <li>The frontpage</li>
      <li>The single portfolio item page</li>
      <li>The article page</li>
      <li>Navigation through portfolio items and articles</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
